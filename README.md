# dazzlehub

This project was built to combine some one'off tools that I built on my off time - that help our marketing team at DAZ.  This entire AngularJS app was also built on my personal free time ha! - feel free to add it to it if any of y'all got some cycles.

## Build & development

Built up with yeoman for a little scaffolding - hosted on my personal VPS on a python http server - live site can be viewed at www.dazzzlehub.com

## Contribute

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.  Use `grunt serve` to host it up locally - to host distrobution run `grunt serve:dist`
